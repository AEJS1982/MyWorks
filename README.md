Hello! Welcome to my github! You can see some of my creations here:

*) AdriStore - a small online store application built originally in ASP.NET MVC, migrated to .NET Core 3.1 + EFCore. It uses Razor, Bootstrap and JQuery for the views.

*) MiniAgenda - a quick demo on how to build a small Agenda using React+Redux Thunk+Boostrap for the frontend + NodeJS/Express for the backend. 
The storage solution I chose is a simple text file in JSON format in MongoDB style.

*)ShoppingLists - a simple app written with Angular 10+Bootstrap as a frontend and Python+Flask as the backend. Right now the frontend is self-sufficient and in the next version I will integrate it with the backend

*)Data Science - a few examples of data science algorithms such as K-Means clustering , Polynomic regressions
I intend to add some more small samples like Bayes classificators and some Neural Networks using Numpy, Pandas,SciKit and MatPlotLib
