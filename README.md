Hello! Welcome to my github! You can see some of my creations here:

*) AdriStore - a small online store application built originally in ASP.NET MVC, migrated to .NET Core 3.1 + EFCore. It uses Razor, Bootstrap and JQuery for the views.

*) MiniAgenda - a quick demo on how to build a small Agenda using React with Redux Thunk for the frontend + NodeJS/Express for the backend. The storage is a simple text file in
JSON format similar to MongoDB
